Arcticons (Arctic icons) is a line-based icon pack forked from [Frost](https://github.com/dkanada/frost) but rebuild with consistent sizing and adjustments specifically for lines in mind. Arcticons is FOSS and provides mostly icons for open-source apps on F-Droid (but there are many other apps in this pack too). The design is simple and clean with minimal lines that give you a nice see-through effect.

Arcticons includes support for a lot of launchers like Trebuchet, KISS, Nova, Apex, Holo, ZenUI, ADW, and many more. The installation depends on your launcher, it's probably somewhere in the settings. **There are over 3200 icons.**

Submitting icon requests helps a lot, but maintaining the project (as you may imagine) takes a lot of time and effort, so please be patient about adding new icons. Contributions for new icons are always welcome, and no experience with programming is necessary.

## Donate

Maintaining this icon-pack costs a lot of time, besides making icons I'm curating every single icon if it has the right sizing and other design rules. So if you like the icons and want to support the development consider supporting. :)

### Submitting icon requests

Historically [Turtl](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.xphnx.iconsubmit/) was used to collect the necessary information for adding missing icons. But now there is an awesome built-in feature to submit icon request right inside the app!  

A simple step-by-step guide:
1. Open Arcticons
2. Press the symbol on the upper-left corner and select `Icon Request`
3. Choose the missing apps you wish to submit, it's also possible to select/deselect all missing apps
4. Press the plane symbol and choose the app in the pop-up menu to send the icon request
5. Now you can check the information that will be sent via email, and if everything looks fine, simply send the email and it's done!

In case you accidentally close the app during the process, and want to clean the cache, there is an option named `Clear Icon Request Data` in `Settings` to do that.

### Making icons

Making icons is fun and **you don't even have to know how to code**. Just install a vector graphic program like [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/), Illustrator, Affinity Designer, [PenPot](https://penpot.app/) or [Vector Asset Creator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.inglesdivino.vectorassetcreator).
