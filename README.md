### Making icons

Making icons is fun and **you don't even have to know how to code**. Just install a vector graphic program like [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/), Illustrator, Affinity Designer, [PenPot](https://penpot.app/) or [Vector Asset Creator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.inglesdivino.vectorassetcreator). 
Read the full details here: 
- [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Inkscape Guide](guides/Inkscape_Guide.md)
- [Vector Asset Creator guide](guides/Vector_Asset_Creator.md)

**Come chat with us on Matrix:**

## Icon requests

### Regular requests
You can request icons with our in-app tool:
1. Open Arcticons
2. Press the symbol in the upper-left corner and select `Icon Request`
3. Choose the missing apps you wish to submit, it's also possible to select/deselect all missing apps
4. Press the plane symbol and choose the app in the pop-up menu to send the icon request
5. Now you can check the information that will be sent via email, and if everything looks fine, simply send the email and it's done!

In case you accidentally close the app during the process, and want to clean the cache, there is an option named `Clear Icon Request Data` in `Settings` to do that.

### Premium requests
If it's taking too long for you, you can also buy priority requests via <a href="https://Ko-fi.com/donno_">Ko-Fi</a>, with this your icon will be the first one in the queue.
