<h2>Icon Requests</h2>

<p>When you request an icon, by default some data is gathered when you send the request.<br>
You can modify what you send in the email:</p>
<ul>
<li>The email address which you send the request with.</li>
<li>The manufacturer, the model, product name, screen resolution, and Android version of your phone.</li>
<li>App version & Candybar version (the app dashboard).</li>
<li>The selection of icons that you choose to send.</li>
</ul>

<p>This information is solely used for the icon request and remains private. <b>You're also fully controlling what data you send to us via email.</b></p>

<p>All mails are securely stored on <a href="https://www.infomaniak.com/en/legal/confidentiality-policy">Infomaniak's servers</a>, and are deleted after they are processed.</p>

<p>The requested icons will be gathered and into our database. All identifiable information is stripped in the process. Only the apps, icons, date of request will be showed in our publicly visible <a href="https://arcticons.com/requests.html">Requests Dashboard</a>.</p>
