A line-based icon pack forked from Frost but rebuild with consistent sizing and adjustments specifically for lines in mind. Arcticons is FOSS and provides mostly icons for open-source apps on F-Droid (but there are many other apps in this pack too). The design is simple and clean with minimal lines that give you a nice see-trough effect.

There are over <b>1000 icons</b>.

Submitting icon requests can be helpful, but maintaining the project takes a lot of time and effort, so please be patient about new icons, so concider donating if you like the project. Most new icons are the result of a pull request from someone who wanted to add support for a specific application. Contributions for new icons are always welcome and no experience with programming is necessary.
