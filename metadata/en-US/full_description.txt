An icon pack forked from ICEcons with the goal of providing icons mostly for F-Droid and other FOSS apps. It was designed to look clean and simple, featuring only white icons and transparency for a see-through effect. Frost includes support for Trebuchet, KISS, Nova, Apex, Holo, ZenUI, ADW, and many more launchers. There are over <b>600 icons</b>, as well as a few <b>4K wallpapers</b> included.

Submitting icon requests can be helpful, but maintaining the project takes a lot of time and effort, so please be patient about new icons. Most new icons are the result of a pull request from someone who wanted to add support for a specific application. Contributions for new icons are always welcome and no experience with programming is necessary.
