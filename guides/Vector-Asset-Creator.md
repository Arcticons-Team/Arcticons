You'll notice that the fill color is white and stroke colour is black.

- Click the fill color tool and slide the fill-opacity slider all the way left, now the fill-color should be transparent.

- Click the stroke color tool [More > stroke color] and set it to any convenient colour. e.g. for contrast.
