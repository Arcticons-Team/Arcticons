## [Supported Launchers â†’](https://github.com/Arcticons-Team/Arcticons/wiki/Supported-Launchers)
A complete list of supported (and unsupported) launchers.

## Material You colors
To change the colors of the icons, you'll need a launcher that handles it well. It also depends on what Android version you're using.

**Android 8+:** Hyperion, Lawnchair 12.1 & 14, Kvaesitso <br>
**Android 12+:** Hyperion, Lawnchair 12.1 & 14, Kvaesitso, Nova, Smart Launcher, Stario, KISS <br>
**On other launchers:** you'll might need to reapply the icon pack every time in order for the color to change.
